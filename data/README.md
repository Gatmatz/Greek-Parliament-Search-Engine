# Data Acquition
Some preprocess or inverted or LSI functions take several hours to create and it is impossible to upload files with such a large capacity. For this reason a link is given that leads to a google drive where various files of the implementation of the work are intended to be downloaded. The files have the titles required and all they require is proper placement in the paths of the task.
